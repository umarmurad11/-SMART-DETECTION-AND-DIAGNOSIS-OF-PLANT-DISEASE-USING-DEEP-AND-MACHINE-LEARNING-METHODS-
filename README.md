Pre-trained deep learning networks (DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3, VGG19, and Xception) and classic machine learning algorithms to detect the diseases on the plants using the plant leaves. 
 First, the experimental component trains models using different plants images. Then, the training of the models that have already been trained.
 According to the results that we get in our experiments in our work, the Xception networks performed admirably from deep learning models. It gives us an accuracy of 89.93%. On other hand, from machine learning algorithms Random Forest performed much better than the SVM and Decision Tree.
 For more Details, I have uploaded my Thesis.
